If a player loses enough points during the game of Nomic to end up with a negative point balance at the end of class, that point balance will be multiplied by -1, giving the player a positive point balance instead of a negative point balance. For example, if a player is left with -40 points at the end of the class meeting, that point balance is converted to 40 points.

If the rule passes, all players, except for the player proposing this rule, receives 15 points.
